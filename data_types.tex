\section{Data Types}
\subsection{Introduction to Data Types}
A data type is a construct in programming that defines what kind of data a
variable can hold and the operations that a programmer can do with this type.
For those who are familiar with programming, integers, floating point numbers,
booleans and strings come to mind. Of course, we can represent much more than
these primitive types by creating a new type and defining its basic
operations. We may for example represent a polynomial and define the addition
of two polynomials as adding the coefficients of the corresponding
same degree variable. There are endless possibilities to represent data in
most programming languages.

The discussion of data types is important as creating new types, changing
between them, and using different operations for the same type is one common
method used in code obfuscation. For example, instead of working with a boolean
$ B $ to check a condition, we can use two integers $ p $ and $ q $, both of
which we can manipulate using integer arithmetic. Hence, wherever we use $ B $,
we may now, for example, add the values of $ p $ and $ q $ and if the sum is
even, that would be equivalent to $ B $ being true.

\subsection{Representing Data Types and Their Operations as Matrices}
One method of obfuscation that we can employ is the use of matrices to obscure
data types and their operations. An easy example would be to represent a
rational number, what would often be a floating point number in programs, as a
matrix.

Let us say we have a variable $ x $, a rational number, that we wish to
represent as a matrix $ A $. We represent this relation as $ x \rightsquigarrow
A $, which means that $ x $ is obfuscated by $ A $. At this point, we need to
define two functions that will help us move between the data type and the
obfuscation.

Our first function is called the abstraction function denoted by $ af: D \to E
$ and is
defined as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    x \rightsquigarrow A \Leftrightarrow x = af (A)
\end{equation*}
Our abstraction function will allow us to retrieve the original value of our
data type using the obfuscation that we have created, in this case $ A $. The
abstraction function is surjective, as there could be several possible
obfuscations that represent the same value. This characteristic allows for less
predictability in the generated code and thus creates less identifiable
patterns that could help someone reverse engineer an application.

Our second function is called the conversion function denoted by $ cf: E \to D
$ and is defined as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    cf (n) = A
\end{equation*}
Our conversion function will take $ x $, what we want to obfuscate, as an input
and output the obfuscation $ A $. This function is the inverse of $ af $.

Now back to the realm of matrices, we need to define our aforementioned
functions. One example would be to have $ cf $ generate an $ A $ such that $ af
$ simply calculates the determinant of $ A $ yielding $ x $. Thus, we may for
example define $ cf $ as follows
\begin{equation*}
    cf(x)
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        x & a \\
        0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
In this example, $ a $ can be absolutely any number and the abstraction
function would simply be
\begin{equation*}
    af \left(
    \begin{bmatrix}
        a & b \\
        c & d
    \end{bmatrix}
    \right)
    =
    \det
    \begin{bmatrix}
        a & b \\
        c & d
    \end{bmatrix}
    = ad - bc
\end{equation*}
We can now test our 2 functions
\begin{equation*}
    af(cf(x)) = x - a(0) = x
\end{equation*}
It works! This is not enough, however, as we still need to define operations
that correspond to basic arithmetic operations. Let us take addition as an
example. We need a function \textbf{plus} such that
\begin{equation*}
    x + y \rightsquigarrow \mathbf{plus(A, B)} : x \rightsquigarrow A, y
    \rightsquigarrow B
\end{equation*}
\textbf{plus} can then be defined as
\begin{equation*}
    plus\left(
    \begin{bmatrix}
        x & a \\
        0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix},
    \begin{bmatrix}
        y & b \\
        0 & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \right)
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        x + y & a + b \\
        0     & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
We can define many more operations beyond addition such as multiplication,
division, subtraction, exponentiation, etc. It is important for these
operations to be defined for our matrices to make our obfuscated code harder to
reverse engineer. It would not be much use to simply represent numbers as
matrices and then convert them back whenever we want to perform arithmetic or
other operations. Moreover, the way we define each operation should also be
sufficiently complex.

It is therefore worth noting that the example above is too simple an
obfuscation to be used in the real world, but it gives a very good sense of how
obfuscation works. A better example, as proposed by Drape et al., would be to
have $ n $ be an eigenvector of a $ 2 \times 2 $ matrix. We would then fix the
second eigenvalue and define a more robust conversion function that is harder
to decipher. If we wish to make our obfuscation stronger, we can make our
matrix bigger for example.


\subsection{Obfuscating Matrices and Their Operations}
The matrix counts as a data type itself, and in the spirit of this paper, it is
also possible to obfuscate matrices and their operations as well. Converting a
number into a matrix as we have seen and then obfuscating that matrix makes our
generated program even harder to decipher, which is what we want.

There are several ways to do obfuscate a matrix, and one that is prominent is
splitting the matrix into a set of several smaller matrices, called the
\textbf{split components}. It follows that matrix operations are again defined
in terms of these components.
