\section{Mixed Boolean Arithmetic}
\subsection{Introduction to Mixed Boolean Arithmetic}
In computer programming, and especially in lower level languages like C or 
assembly as we'll be looking at in this paper, numbers are represented
not in decimal but binary with a limited number of bits allocated to the 
variable. That means each number is represented in memory as a bit-vector of
the form $\{0,1\}^n$, where $n$ is the ``word size'', that is, the maximum 
size of a given number. Using these bit-vector numbers, we can use different
operations based on how we treat them, I.E. using bitwise operators such as
$\ll$ and $\gg$ for shifting bits right and left, $\land$ and $\lor$, $\neg$, 
and $\oplus$, or using traditional arithmetic operators $+, -, \times,$ etc.
When using bitwise operators, it is certainly more clear to treat the 
number as a bit-vector, while when using traditional arithmetic operators
we get the same result by taking the result of normal arithmetic over the ring 
($\Z/2^n\Z$) (since we can't increase the word size, any time the result we
get is larger than can be represented in $\{0,1\}^n$, the upper bits are truncated).
\par Now, to formally define an expression of this type (will fill in ?'s in final draft):
\thm{Definition ?} {Let $n,s,t \in \N$, $x_i$ be a variable over $\{0,1\}^n$ for
$i = 1,...,t$, and $e_j : (\{0,1\}^n)^t \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ be a bitwise expression for
$j = 1,...,s$. Let $a_j\in \{0,1\}^n$ be a coefficient for $j = 1,...,s$.
Then, a linear MBA expression $e$ is an expression that can be written as follows:
\begin{align*}
    e(x_1, ..., x_t) = \sum_{j=1}^s a_j e_j(x_1,...,x_t)
\end{align*}
}
\par Since we've now defined the the essential operators we have in mixed-boolean 
arithmetic
expressions, we can imagine several situations where a programmer might use expressions 
that they would rather keep secret. In cryptography-relevant code, we may use any
number of cryptographic methods that are composed of MBA (mixed boolean arithmetic)
expressions
and wish to keep the exact constituent operations hidden 
to dissuade attackers.

    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c"yamomma"c}
        $x & $y$ & $x \oplus y$ \\
        \hline
        0 & 0 & 0 \\
        1 & 0 & 1 \\
        0 & 1 & 1 \\
        1 & 1 & 0 \\
    \end{tabular}
\end{align*}
\subsection{Mixed Boolean Arithmetic in Linear Algebra}
Now, there are two ways to re-write an MBA expression as something more complex, 
re-writing and inserting identities. Inserting identities means to tag onto
the expression some MBA expression that is always 0, and re-writing means to 
replace an expression with one that is equivalent. First, let's look at methods
of generating and proving identities. There is one critically important theorem 
that will allow us to generate arbitrary MBA identities:
\thm{Theorem ?}{Let e be a linear MBA expression with the same variable definitions
as in Definition ?. Then let $(v_{0,j},...,v_{2^t-1, j})$ be the column vector
of the truth table of the Boolean expression from $e_j$, and let 
$A = (v_{i,j})_{2^t \times s}$ be the $\{0,1\}$ matrix of truth tables over ($\Z/2^n\Z$).
Let $Y_{s \times 1} = (y_0, \dots, y_{s-1})^T$ be a vector of $s$ variables over
$(\Z/2^n\Z)$. Then $e = 0$ if and only if $AY = 0$ has a solution over $(\Z/2^n\Z)$.}
\pf{INSERT PROOF IN FINAL DRAFT}
What this theorem essentially allows us to do is build any matrix $A$
composed of column vectors that are truth table values, then solve the 
equation $Ax = 0$ for some vector $x$, and we'll have an identity MBA expression.
For example, consider the matrix:
\begin{align*}
    F = \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
        0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1\\
        1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
        1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1\\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
{\color{blue} NOTE: here we will have to include a brief explanation of truth tables and two's 
complement.\\}
This matrix is composed of truth table values for the following functions (where 
$f_i$ represents the function in the $i$'th column) :
\begin{align*}
    f_0(x,y) &= x\\
    f_1(x,y) &= y\\
    f_2(x,y) &= x \oplus y\\
    f_3(x,y) &= x \lor (\neg y)\\
    f_4(x,y) &= -1
\end{align*}
(Where we've defined -1 to be all 1's as in two's complement representation).
Then, solving for $Ax = 0$, we get:
\begin{align*}
    x = \begin{bmatrix}
    1\\-1\\-1\\-2\\2
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
So, plugging in our expressions from the functions the matrix was composed of, 
we get the following equation:
\begin{align*}
    x - y - (x \oplus y) -2(x \lor (\neg y)) + 2 =0
\end{align*}
{\color{blue} TODO: Prove that this holds for arbitrarily sized bit-vectors, show other 
examples, }
\subsection{Obfuscating Mixed Boolean Arithmetic}
Now, using the method in the previous section to generate MBA inequalities works well,
but we can also use it to find MBA equalities that allow us to rewrite our original
expression. Take the first example:
\begin{align*} 
    x - y - (x \oplus y) -2(x \lor (\neg y)) + 2 = 0\\
    \implies x - y = (x \oplus y) + 2(x \lor (\neg y)) - 2
\end{align*}
Then, in any MBA expression that contains $(x - y)$, we can replace it with
the expression on the right. Since we can generate arbitrary MBA identities, 
we can compose any matrix that includes some of the operations in whichever
MBA expression we'd like to obfuscate, and then use the resulting equality
to replace expressions with equivalent ones as long as we'd like to! 
\par Now, this seems great as we can apparently introduce arbitrary arithmetic
complexity into whichever expressions we use. But, there are some other 
considerations here: first and foremost, introducing more complexity harms
performance, and if the code that we're obfuscating is performance-critical, 
this is an important trade-off to consider. Secondly, MBA obfuscation 
isn't perfect, and there are a few ways to combat it.\\
